# Contributing to CyberSoc Kali

Thanks for wanting to contribute to our repo! Here are some guidelines we ask you to follow:

## Issues

If you find any issues with the ISO, please open an [issue](https://github.com/CyberSocYork/CyberSocKali/issues/new/choose). This will allow us to fix the issue as soon as possible. Please be as descriptive as possible in your issue, as this will help us to reproduce the problem

## Feature requests

If there is a change you would like to see made to anything in this repo (the package list, the configuration of the image, or the build process), please open an issue requesting this.

## Pull requests

If you feel comfortable working on a change or fix yourself, please feel free to send us a pull request. We suggest that you open an issue discussing the change before you start work, as we may decide to reject changes, and we do not want people wasting their time. We will still review pull requests that do not have a related issue, but please be aware that we may reject your change.
